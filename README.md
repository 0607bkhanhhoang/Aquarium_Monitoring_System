This is my milestone project at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology . This project show the way to design a datalogger for Aquarium or Remote Area Environtment, combining with UCLA Star and YOLOv11, this project contains an application web for detection

# Requirement
:pushpin:  **For Hardware Design**
1. 7cm x 7cm is the optimize size for PCB 
2. 4 Channels reading analog parameters : pH, Turbidity, Oxygen, Light
3. Wifi modules integrated

:pushpin: **For Web Development**
1. Design Web deployed on Raspberry Pi 5, open port on local wifi.
2. Web can detect by **Video** and **Real time Detecting** using YOLO and UCLA Star Model.
3. Data Collection and charts for analysis by Java.
